# Assignment 2: Pokedex

The task was to develop a react based web app that displays a Pokedex, featuring an overview (and details) of all the Pokemons.

## Requirements:

  - Pokémon information must be retrieved from pokeapi, which you should already be familiar with.
  - The Pokédex must display a list of Pokémon and support simple pagination (e.g. “next” and “previous” buttons to get the next/previous page of Pokémon), such that not all Pokémon are displayed at the same time.
  - When a user clicks on a specific Pokémon, additional information about that Pokémon must be displayed. E.g. type(s), stats, abiltities, height and weight.
  - The application must contain multiple pages (e.g. "pokedex" and "about") and utilize React Router to route between them.
  - The application must be developed using Vite.

## Design template:
The webpage was first sketched with drawio, where the main layout was drawn up and then converted to react components. These form the basis of the entire react based application.
