## Assignment 1: Tic-Tac-Toe

Goal was to develop 2 JavaScript based html pages (without any external dependencies), where you can play tic-tac-toe. The 2 implementations should use either an Object-Oriented approach, or a Functional Programming approach - show casing both approaches. The UI and "feel" when playing should be indistinguishable between the two, for the user.
